How to run:
This is a program created to demonstrate socket communication for CSCI 466, in order to use the file please launch the server program first and then the client program. In order for proper functionality please choose values in the rows and columns to be between 1 and 6, otherwise, the program will crash as it will try to access a list out of bounds. The program terminates on sinking all ships.
