How to run:
This is a program created to demonstrate socket communication for CSCI 466 and to demo TCP protocol, in order to use the file please
launch the server program first and then the client program. In order for the program to funtion properly you must end every sentence 
with either a ".", "!", or "?" or else the program will crash as the program will not detect the end of the message. The program terminates
after sending back the translated message.
